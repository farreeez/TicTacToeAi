# TicTacToeAi

This project is a Tic-tac-toe game run using Java Swing, where you can play against an undefeatable AI created using a dynamic programming concept called value iteration.

## Description

The primary goal of this project was to solidify my understanding of reinforcement learning concepts through practical application. In this game, value iteration is utilized to enable the AI to make optimal decisions by iteratively updating the value of each game state based on possible future rewards, ensuring it always selects the best move to prevent losing.

### Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* Java Swing

Make sure you have the JDK installed and properly configured on your system, as well as the Java Swing library, which is typically included with the JDK.

### Executing program

* simply run the Main.java file and enjoy :).
